"""``physai`` CLI surface checks.

These exercise the developer-facing CLI through a real subprocess so we
catch breakage in CLI argparse wiring, doctor checks, and Slurm
list/status/logs plumbing. The CLI talks to the cluster through the
regression's ``--ssh-config`` tempfile — ``~/.ssh/config`` is not used.
